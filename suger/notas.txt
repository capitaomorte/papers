He urged the king to destroy the feudal bandits, was responsible for
the royal tactics in dealing with the communal movements, and
endeavoured to regularize the administration of justice. He left his
abbey, which possessed considerable property, enriched and embellished
by the construction of a new church built in the nascent Gothic
style. Suger wrote extensively on the construction of the abbey in
Liber de Rebus in Administratione sua Gestis, Libellus Alter de
Consecratione Ecclesiae Sancti Dionysii, and Ordinatio. In the 1940s,
the prominent art-historian Erwin Panofsky claimed that the theology
of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite influenced the architectural style
of the abbey of St. Denis, though later scholars have argued against
such a simplistic link between philosophy and architectural form.[1]
Similarly the assumption by 19th century French authors that Suger was
the "designer" of St Denis (and hence the "inventor" of Gothic
architecture) has been almost entirely discounted by more recent
scholars. Instead he is generally seen as having been a bold and
imaginative patron who encouraged the work of an innovative (but now
unknown) master mason.[2][3]

A chalice once owned by Suger is now in the collections of the
National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.
